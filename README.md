# AP-Chemistry-Titration-Programs
## Overview
These are programs I created during my sophmore year of Highschool when I took AP chemistry. The programs are able to solve a varity of tritration problems such 
as (Strong acid--Strong base, Strong acid--Weak base, Weak acid--Strong base and Strong base--Strong acid). 
The programs use equations I derived during my chemistry class


## Repository information
- chemMath.py:  Is a file that contains all chemistry functions that are used in the Acid-Base_Final.py runner file
- Acid-Base_Final.py:  Is a command line GUI that will allow you selected diffrent menus and options
- soltxt.py:  Is a program that will generate over 3000 data points and graph an accurate tritration curves based on input parameters.
