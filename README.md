# AP-Chemistry-Titration-Programs
## Overview
* These are programs I created during my sophmore year of Highschool when I took AP chemistry. The programs are able to solve and model a varity of acid-base tritration reactions such as (Strong acid--Strong base, Strong acid--Weak base, Weak acid--Strong base and Strong base--Strong acid). 
 * The equations I derived to model these reactions will be posted soon on a seperate file


## Repository information
- chemMath.py: Is a file that contains all chemistry functions that are used in the Acid-Base_Final.py runner file
- Acid-Base_Final.py: Is a command line GUI that will allow you to select diffrent menus and options
- soltxt.py: Is a program that will generate over 3000 data points and graph an accurate tritration curve based on input parameters.
