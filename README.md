# AP-Chemistry-Tritration-Programs
## Overview
These are programs I created during my sophmore year of Highschool when I took AP chemistry. These programs are able to solve a varity of tritration problems such as
as (Strong acid--Strong base, Strong acid--Weak base, Weak acid--Strong base and Strong base--Strong acid). These programs use equations I derived and are coded in python.


## Repository Description
chemMath.py: Is a file that contains all chemistry functions that are used in the Acid-Base_Final.py runner file
Acid-Base_Final.py: Is a command line GUI that will allow you selected diffrent menus and options
soltxt.py: Is a program that will generate over 3000 data points and graph an accurate tritration curves based on input parameters.
