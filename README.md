# AP-Chemistry-Tritration-Programs

These are programs I created during my sophmore year of Highschool when I took AP chemistry. These programs are able to solve a varity of tritration problems such as
as (Strong acid--Strong base, Strong acid--Weak base, Weak acid--Strong base and Strong base--Strong acid). These programs use equations I derived and are coded in python.
